# ESP8266-FastLED-LightController

This is a simple Web Server built using the ESP8266 Web Module, which controls WS2811 LED lights in my room. Currently, the web page only
controls a single set of LEDs, but I plan on extending the project to have multiple ESP8266 boards, which will interact using ESPNOW.
